# Chajrti Backend

Chajrti's backend is developed using NestJS, structured into several modules to manage different aspects of the application efficiently.

### Modules:

- **Client**: Manages user roles with guards and interfaces.
- **Favorites**: Handles plant favorites.
- **Order**: Manages client orders.
- **Plant**: CRUD operations for plant data.

### Additional Components:

- **Enums**: Enumerations to define constants or types used across modules.
- **Decorators**: Custom decorators to enhance functionality or metadata handling within NestJS.

### Architecture:

NestJS ensures modular separation for scalability and maintainability, leveraging TypeScript for type safety.

### Technologies:

- **NestJS**: Efficient Node.js framework.
- **TypeScript**: Enhances development productivity and reliability.

  
This backend architecture ensures that Chajrti can handle complex interactions between clients, orders, favorites, and plants seamlessly, providing a robust foundation for the Flutter frontend application.
